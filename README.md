# Twitter-Text-Analysis
An automatic text analisys of tweets

This is my first big project alone.
This consist in an automatic text analysis made of tweets. It's made with shiny, but it haven't been upload to any web page yet.
In principle, if you run the full program a shiny window opens. Then you have to write the hashtag you want and the number of tweets you want to download for the analysis. You have take into account that if you download too much tweets the program will be slow.
Once the tweets are downloaded, differents windows that offer different information are created automaticly.
This project can halp to do any analysis based on what the social networks says. But I may work better with spanish and south american topics because of the language.

The project is not finished yet. This is a "beta version"
